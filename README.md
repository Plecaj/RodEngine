# RodEngine

**RodEngine** is a custom C++ game engine I'm building from scratch. It's currently based on [The Cherno's](https://www.youtube.com/@TheCherno) game engine series, which serves as the foundation for learning and early development. Once I complete the tutorials, I plan to expand the engine with my own architecture, features, and tools.
