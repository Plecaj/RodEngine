# RodEngine

**RodEngine** is a custom C++ game engine I'm building from scratch. It's currently based on [The Cherno's](https://www.youtube.com/@TheCherno) game engine series, which serves as the foundation for learning and early development. Once I complete the tutorials, I plan to expand the engine with my own architecture, features, and tools.

## 🚧 Development Status

> ⚠️ RodEngine is in early development. Expect rapid changes, incomplete systems, and experimental features.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Platform:** Windows
- **Language:** C++
- **Build System:** Premake5  
- **Rendering:** OpenGL 
- **Windowing & Input:** GLFW  
- **Math Library:** GLM  
- **GUI:** ImGui
- **ECS library:** entt 
- **Logging:** spdlog  
- **Image Loading:** stb_image  

## 🎯 Goals

- Both 2D and 3D rendering
- Support for other rendering API's
- Support other platforms - such as linux, mobile
- Built-in scene editor - GUI
- Audio playback control
- Scripting
