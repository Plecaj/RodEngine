# RodEngine

**RodEngine** is a custom C++ game engine I'm building from scratch. It's currently based on [The Cherno's](https://www.youtube.com/@TheCherno) game engine series, which serves as the foundation for learning and early development. Once I complete the tutorials, I plan to expand the engine with my own architecture, features, and tools.

## 🚧 Development Status

> ⚠️ RodEngine is in early development. Expect rapid changes, incomplete systems, and experimental features.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Language:** C++  
- **Rendering:** OpenGL  (Vulcan/DirectX support planned)
- **Windowing & Input:** GLFW  
- **OpenGL Function Loader:** Glad  
- **Math Library:** GLM  
- **GUI:** ImGui  
- **Logging:** spdlog  
- **Image Loading:** stb_image  
- **Build System:** Premake5  
- **Platform:** Windows (Linux/macOS support planned)

## 🎯 Goals

- Learn and implement modern engine architecture  
- Build a flexible and modular codebase  
- Support both 2D and 3D rendering  
- Develop custom tools, scripting, and physics in later stages
